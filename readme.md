Develop a console-based Budget Tracking System that stores and manages financial data using a MySQL database. The program must allow a user to record expenses by capturing details such as name, category, amount, and date; view all stored expenses; calculate the total expenses for the current month automatically; define monthly budget limits; and compute the remaining budget by comparing the month’s total spending with the saved budget limit. All features should interact directly with MySQL through parameterized SQL queries, and the system should operate through a simple menu-driven interface. The design assumes a single user, basic input validation, and automatic month detection for budget calculations.
